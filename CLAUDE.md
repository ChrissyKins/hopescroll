Follow the following guidelines:
- Commit to git often
- Make good use of checklists! Especially when linting etc
- Refer to docs in /docs when you have questions, especially /docs/planning
- Try not to overcomplicate!
- Before you finish, please verify your solution
- When you update or modify core context files, also update markdown documentation and memory bank
- When asked to commit changes, exclude CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE-*.md referenced memory bank system files from any commits. Never delete these files.
- Keep a work plan checklist in a .md file for a session and clean it up when you're done
- If you try to use a command and it's not working/not set up in the environment and you are unable to install it/get it working, stop and ask me to install it, giving me the commands to do so.
- Test new functionality as you go, integration tests are best. Don't use mocks.
- Lint as you go.

RULES TO FOLLOW

### Session End Checklist (Complete Before Stopping!)

**Always run this checklist before ending your session:**

- [ ] ✅ Updated [PROJECT_STATUS.md](./docs/planning/PROJECT_STATUS.md) with changes
- [ ] ✅ Updated [FEATURE_ROADMAP.md](./docs/planning/FEATURE_ROADMAP.md) if working on epics
- [ ] ✅ Ran `npm run test` and all tests pass
- [ ] ✅ Ran `npm run lint` and fixed issues
- [ ] ✅ Committed all changes with descriptive messages
- [ ] ✅ Updated "Last Updated" dates in modified docs
- [ ] ✅ Left clear notes for next session

**Why:** The next agent needs clear context. This 10-minute investment saves 30+ minutes later!

See [CLAUDE-SESSION-GUIDE.md](./CLAUDE-SESSION-GUIDE.md) for detailed session workflow.

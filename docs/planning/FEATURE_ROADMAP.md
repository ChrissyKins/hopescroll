# HopeScroll - Feature Plan & Roadmap

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## Executive Summary

**HopeScroll** is a curated content consumption app designed to replace doom-scrolling on X/Reddit with intentional, filtered content from trusted sources. The app currently features a TikTok-style video player for YouTube content and aims to add a Reddit-style scrolling feed for news, blogs, podcasts, and RSS feeds.

### Core Philosophy
- **Curated over algorithmic**: User chooses sources, not an algorithm
- **Filtered by default**: Heavy filtering to avoid politics, drama, negativity
- **Engaging but healthy**: Fun to use without the toxicity
- **Intentional consumption**: Break the indecision cycle
- **ADHD-friendly**: Scratch the scroll itch without context switching or doom-scrolling

### Design Principles for ADHD
1. **No context switching** - Everything readable in-app, no outlinks to break flow
2. **Fast dopamine hits** - Quick content (short videos, readable articles)
3. **Visual variety** - Mix of videos, images, text to maintain interest
4. **Clear progress indicators** - "2 min left", completion bars, streak counters
5. **Frictionless actions** - One tap to save, dismiss, or keep scrolling
6. **Gentle boundaries** - Time limits, "you've scrolled for 30min" nudges (not hard stops)
7. **Hyperfocus friendly** - Can dive deep into topics without losing place
8. **Easy re-engagement** - Pick up where you left off, saved position in long articles

  // Article-specific
  readTime       Int?         // Estimated minutes
  excerpt        String?      @db.Text
  fullContent    String?      @db.Text

  // Engagement tracking
  scrollDepth    Float?       // For articles: how far user scrolled (0-1)

  @@index([contentType])
  @@index([readTime])
}

enum ContentType {
  VIDEO
  ARTICLE
  PODCAST
}
```

### New Table: ReadingProgress

- `GET /api/sources/validate-rss?url=` - Validate RSS feed
- `POST /api/sources/fetch-article` - Fetch full article content
- `GET /api/content/article/:id` - Get full article content

### Feed Generation
- `GET /api/feed?type=all|video|article` - Get mixed or filtered feed
- `GET /api/feed/recommendations` - Personalized recommendations

### Reading Progress
- `POST /api/content/:id/progress` - Update reading progress
- `GET /api/content/:id/progress` - Get saved progress

## Technical Decisions & Trade-offs

### 1. Article Content Extraction
**Options:**
- **A) Fetch only RSS content (summary)**
  - ✅ Pro: Fast, no scraping needed
  - ❌ Con: Often just summaries, forces external navigation
  - ❌ Con: Breaks the engagement flow (context switching kills ADHD focus)

- **B) Scrape full article content (CHOSEN)**
  - ✅ Pro: Full reading experience in-app
  - ✅ Pro: Can track engagement better
  - ✅ Pro: **No context switching - keep the scroll flow going**
  - ✅ Pro: Can optimize for ADHD-friendly reading (formatting, pacing)
  - ❌ Con: More complex, can break with site changes
  - ❌ Con: Potential legal/ethical concerns (respect robots.txt, paywalls)

**Decision:** Use (B) - scrape full article content. This is critical for ADHD-friendly engagement. The app needs to scratch the same itch as Reddit/X without forcing users to leave and lose focus.

### 2. Feed Algorithm
**Options:**
- **A) Pure chronological**
  - ✅ Pro: Simple, transparent
  - ❌ Con: Less engaging, may bury good content

- **B) Ranked by engagement + recency (chosen)**
  - ✅ Pro: More engaging, surfaces best content
  - ✅ Pro: Still user-controlled (from curated sources)
  - ⚠️ Caution: Avoid filter bubble

**Decision:** Use (B) with strong user controls and transparency.

### 3. Content Storage
**Options:**
- **A) Store full article content in database**
  - ✅ Pro: Fast loading, works offline
  - ❌ Con: Large database size, storage costs

- **B) Store only metadata, fetch content on-demand (chosen)**
  - ✅ Pro: Smaller database
  - ✅ Pro: Always fresh content (no stale cached content)
  - ❌ Con: Slower loading, depends on external sites

**Decision:** Use (B) for now, add optional caching for saved articles.

## Success Metrics

### Product Metrics (Track These!)
- **Daily Active Users (DAU):** Target 100 in first month
- **Session Duration:** Target 15+ minutes per session
- **Content Consumption:**
  - Videos watched per session: 5+
  - Articles read per session: 3+
- **Retention:**
  - Day 1: 60%

- **Engagement:**
  - % users who add 3+ sources: 70%
  - % users who set up filters: 50%
  - % users who save content: 60%

### Health Metrics (Avoid Bad Patterns!)
- **Doomscroll Prevention:** Session duration shouldn't exceed 60 minutes (warn user)
- **Filter Effectiveness:** % of content dismissed for negative reasons < 10%
- **User Satisfaction:** Monthly survey, target 4+/5 rating

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|------------|
| RSS feeds frequently change/break | High | High | Health monitoring, auto-fix, user notifications |
| Article scraping blocked by sites | Medium | Medium | Respect robots.txt, use official APIs when available, fallback to summaries |
| Feed becomes boring/repetitive | High | Medium | Strong recommendation algorithm, source discovery, diversity controls |
| Scope creep (too many features) | High | High | **Ruthless prioritization, MVP first, iterate** |
| User retention low | High | Medium | Onboarding flow, engagement features, daily habits (digest email) |
| Content moderation failures (toxic content gets through) | Medium | Medium | Layered filtering, user reporting, AI moderation |

---

## Open Questions & Decisions Needed

1. **Article Reader UI:** ✅ DECIDED
   - **In-app only** (inline expansion in feed, no outlinks as primary action)
   - **Store full article content** (scrape with readability parser)
   - Goal: Keep the dopamine loop going like Reddit/X, but healthy

2. **Monetization:**
   - Free app with limits (X sources, Y filters)?
   - Premium subscription?
   - Donate/tip model?
   - Stay free forever?

3. **Content Types:**
   - Start with RSS only, or add specific integrations (Substack, Medium, etc.)?
   - Support newsletters (email forwarding)?
   - Support podcasts (audio player)?

4. **Social Features:**
   - Keep it fully private (no social)?
   - Light social (follow friends, share collections)?
   - Public profiles and discovery?

5. **Moderation:**
   - Rely on user filters only?
   - Add AI moderation layer?
   - Community moderation (report button)?

### Interaction Flow:
1. User scrolls feed, sees article card (collapsed)
2. Taps "Read" or anywhere on card
3. Card smoothly expands inline (0.3s animation)
4. User reads in place, progress bar updates
5. When done: tap "Continue Scrolling" or just scroll past
6. Card auto-collapses when scrolled off screen
7. If interrupted: progress saved, "Resume reading" badge appears

### Key ADHD-Friendly Elements:
- **No page navigation** - everything happens inline
- **Progress indicator** - know exactly how much is left
- **TL;DR** - can skim before committing to full read
- **Visual hierarchy** - headings, bullets, images break monotony
- **One-tap actions** - save/dismiss without thinking
- **Frictionless exit** - collapse anytime, resume later

# HopeScroll - Product Vision
**The healthy alternative to X and Reddit**

---

## The Problem

### What's wrong with X (Twitter) and Reddit?

❌ **Algorithmic rage-bait** - Designed to make you angry for engagement
❌ **Politics everywhere** - Can't escape the drama
❌ **Doom-scrolling** - Feel worse after using it
❌ **Filter bubble** - Algorithm shows you what keeps you clicking, not what's good for you
❌ **Comparison/FOMO** - Everyone's life looks better than yours
❌ **Indecision paralysis** - Endless options, can't choose what to consume
❌ **Outlink hell** - Click through 5 pages to read one article

### But... they're also addictive

✅ Endless scroll - never runs out
✅ Visual variety - images, videos, text
✅ Fast dopamine hits - quick content, instant gratification
✅ Easy actions - one tap to save, like, share
✅ Social proof - see what's popular

**The core insight:** They're addictive because of the UX, toxic because of the content/algorithm.

---

## The Solution: HopeScroll

### What if we kept the addictive UX but fixed the content?

**HopeScroll = Reddit's UX + Your curated sources + Heavy filtering**

---

## How It Works

### 1. You Choose Your Sources (Not an Algorithm)
- Add YouTube channels you trust
- Add RSS feeds from blogs/news you like
- Preset packs for quick start ("Tech News", "Science", "Wholesome")
- No algorithmic suggestions (unless you explicitly ask)

### 2. Heavy Filtering by Default
- Block keywords (politics, drama, negativity)
- Filter by content length (only 5-10min videos, 3min articles)
- Filter by publish date (only fresh content)
- Source safety levels (mark sources as "always safe")

### 3. Engaging Feed Experience
- Reddit-style scrolling feed
- Mix of videos and articles
- Inline reading (no outlinks!)
- One-tap actions (save, dismiss, not now)
- Progress tracking (know how much is left)

### 4. ADHD-Friendly Design
- No context switching (everything in-app)
- Clear progress indicators
- Resume where you left off
- Gentle time boundaries (nudges, not hard stops)
- Celebration of completion ("Nice work! 🎉")

| Too complex to set up | Preset source packs, quick onboarding |
| Content scraping breaks | Fallback to excerpts, focus on RSS-friendly sources |
| Hard to monetize (free app) | Freemium model (limits on sources/filters), premium later |
| Legal issues (scraping content) | Respect robots.txt, focus on RSS, get permission |
